When I look up at the purple panorama
of the galactic highway,
a shooting star
passes through my heart.

In the sleepless city,
my heartbeat accelerates once more
when I wish for
the unseen future.

That melody I hear...
That mysterious voice won't let me go.

Please tell me, seventh moon,
why my heart's so anxious
Are you taking me somewhere?
Palely shaking, seventh moon,
to the echoing rhythm,
I'm just searching for an answer to the maddening dance.

The silver dome
catches the reflection of the sunny sky
as I try to figure out
my dried-up heart.

That melody I hear...
The unshakeable power revives me.

Please answer, seventh moon,
the riddle of this power.
Am I chasing some kind of rainbow?
Dissolving in the darkness, seventh moon,
time passes by
so that some day I can continue the dream I had lost.

As long as the parade continues,
aim for a new tomorrow.

Please tell me, seventh moon,
why my heart's so anxious
Are you taking me somewhere?
Palely shaking, seventh moon,
to the echoing rhythm,
I'm just searching for an answer to the maddening dance.
