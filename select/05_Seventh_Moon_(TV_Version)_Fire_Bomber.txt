Murasaki no PANORAMA
Ginga no HAIUEI miagereba
Ore no mune wo
Tsuranuku shooting star

Nemuranai machi ni
Kasokusuru HA-TOBI-TO kasanete wa
Mienai asu ni
Futo inoru toki

Kikoete-kuru ano MERODI-
Fushigi na ano koe ga ore wo hanasanai

Oshiete kure seventh moon
Kono mune no moyamoya wo
Ore wo doko e to tsurete-yuku no ka
Aoku yureru seventh moon
Hibi-ite kure RIZUMU ni
Ikareta DANSU de kotae wo sagasu dake sa

Gin'iro no DO-MU ga
Utsushidasu sunny sky uketomete
Kawaita kokoro
Tashikameru toki

Kikoete-kuru ano MERODI-
Yuruginai chikara ga ore no yomigaeru

Kotaete kure seventh moon
Kono chikara no nazo wo
Donna niji wo kakerareru no ka
Yami ni tokeru seventh moon
Toki wa nagarete-yuku
Nakushita shimatta yume no tsuzuki wo itsuka

PARE-DO wa tsuzuite'ku
Atarashii asahi mezashite

Oshiete kure seventh moon
Kono mune no moyamoya wo
Ore wo doko e to tsurete-yuku no ka
Aoku yureru seventh moon
Hibi-ite kure RIZUMU ni
Ikareta DANSU de kotae wo sagasu dake sa

When I look up at the purple panorama
Of the galactic highway,
A shooting star
Passes through my heart.

In the sleepless city,
My heartbeat accelerates once more
When I wish for
The unseen future.

That melody I hear...
That mysterious voice won't let me go.

Please tell me, seventh moon,
Why my heart's so anxious
Are you taking me somewhere?
Palely shaking, seventh moon,
To the echoing rhythm,
I'm just searching for an answer to the maddening dance.

The silver dome
Catches the reflection of the sunny sky
As I try to figure out
My dried-up heart.

That melody I hear...
The unshakeable power revives me.

Please answer, seventh moon,
The riddle of this power.
Am I chasing some kind of rainbow?
Dissolving in the darkness, seventh moon,
Time passes by
So that some day I can continue the dream I had lost.

As long as the parade continues,
Aim for a new tomorrow.

Please tell me, seventh moon,
Why my heart's so anxious
Are you taking me somewhere?
Palely shaking, seventh moon,
To the echoing rhythm,
I'm just searching for an answer to the maddening dance.

Kotaete kure seventh moon
Kono chikara no nazo wo
Donna niji wo kakerareru no ka
Yami ni tokeru seventh moon
Toki wa nagarete-yuku
Nakushita shimatta yume no tsuzuki wo itsuka
