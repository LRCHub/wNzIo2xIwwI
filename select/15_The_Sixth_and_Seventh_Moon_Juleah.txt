Without you
Forever I'd stay
On the surface

Without you
Never I'd see
Beneath the curtains

Only when he shows I can pervade
The sixth and the seventh moon
To silence the storm
Inside me

Without you
All that I see
Is in chaos

Without you
Dull routine
Swallows me

It's coming closer

Did you ever shine
Shine so brightly
And for all that you have done
Reward's round the corner
I wonder where the rays
That shine through are going
Did you ever peak inside
Inside your being
Did you ever shine
Shine so brightly
And for all that you have done
Reward's round the corner
